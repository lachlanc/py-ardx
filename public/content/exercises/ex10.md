What's the next phenomena we will measure with our
Arduino? Temperature. To do this we'll use a rather
complicated IC (integrated circuit) hidden in a package (TO92)
identical to our P2N2222AG transistors. It has three pins,
ground, signal and +5 volts, and is easy to use. It outputs 10
millivolts per degree centigrade on the signal pin (to allow measuring temperatures below 
freezing there is a 500 mV offset eg. 25° C = 750 mV, 0° C = 500mV). To convert this from
the digital value to degrees, we will use some of the Arduino's math abilities.  We'll output the value to the console. Let's get to it.

## Troubleshooting

### Nothing Seems to Happen
This program has no outward indication it is working. To see the results you must look at the console output.

### Temperature Value is Unchanging
Try pinching the sensor with your fingers to heat it up or pressing a bag of ice against it to cool it down.

## Extending the Code

### Outputting degrees Fahrenheit:
This is a simple change requiring only algebra. To
convert degrees C to degrees F we use the formula:  

`F = (C * 1.8) + 32`

Add the line:

	fahrenheit = (cel * 1.8) + 32;
